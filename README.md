# Advent of Code

Repo to collect AoC solution by me. I'll do as many as I can each year.

## Organization
Year by year folder with named language in it for the languages I used. It MAY be a subrepo until I move the code over to this main repo.
No guarentees

## TODO:
- add script to run (or little rust/python/julia)
- add links
